                        <p>The <strong>Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of Saint Peter in York</strong>, commonly known
                            as <strong>York Minster</strong>, is the cathedral of York, England, and is one of the largest
                            of its kind in Northern Europe. The minster is the seat of the Archbishop of York, the second-highest
                            office of the Church of England, and is the mother church for the Diocese of York and the Province
                            of York. It is run by a dean and chapter, under the Dean of York. The title "minster" is attributed
                            to churches established in the Anglo-Saxon period as missionary teaching churches, and serves now
                            as an honorific title. Services in the minster are sometimes regarded as on the High Church or
                            Anglo-Catholic end of the Anglican continuum.</p>

                        <h3>York Castle</h3>
                        <p><strong>York Castle</strong> in the city of York, England, is a fortified complex comprising, over
                            the last nine centuries, a sequence of castles, prisons, law courts and other buildings on the
                            south side of the River Foss. The now-ruinous keep of the medieval Norman castle is commonly
                            referred to as <strong>Clifford's Tower</strong>. Built originally on the orders of William I to
                            dominate the former Viking city of York, the castle suffered a tumultuous early history before
                            developing into a major fortification with extensive water defences. After a major explosion in
                            1684 rendered the remaining military defences uninhabitable, York Castle continued to be used as
                            a jail and prison until 1929.</p>

                            the River Ouse. They cover an area of 10 acres (4.0 ha) of the former grounds of St Mary's Abbey,
                            and were created in the 1830s by the Yorkshire Philosophical Society along with the Yorkshire
                            Museum which they contain.</p>

                        <p><strong>The Shambles</strong> (official name <strong>Shambles</strong>) is an old street in York,
                            England, with overhanging timber-framed buildings, some dating back as far as the fourteenth century.
                            It was once known as <strong>The Great Flesh Shambles</strong>, probably from the Anglo-Saxon
                            Fleshammels (literally 'flesh-shelves'), the word for the shelves that butchers used to display
                            their meat. As recently as 1872 twenty-five butchers' shops were located along the street, but now
                            none remain.</p>
